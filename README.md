# Undergrad-Dissertation-Code
R Code used to analyse and visualise data from my investigation of the fortis/lenis distinction in Irish 

The most important files are the all_segs csv file, which contains all the segments, marked for Speaker, File, Segment type etc. and the various R (RMD) code files, which were used to conduct the statistical analysis

The Textgrid files (20 in total) contain the raw information on segments, drawn directly from Praat binaries
